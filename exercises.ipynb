    "    - Teen (13–19)\n",

Write this question in your `app.py` file above the call to your visualization function, using `st.write(\"Your Question Here\")`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "7. Create a Plotly visualization in a function named `visualize_demographic()` that directly addresses your question by returning a Plotly figure (e.g., `fig = px. ...`). You are free to choose the chart type that you think best communicates the findings. Be creative — try different approaches, compare them, and ensure that your chart clearly answers the question you posed.\n"
